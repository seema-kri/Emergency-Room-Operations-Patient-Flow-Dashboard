# 🏥 Emergency Room Operations Dashboard — Patient Flow & Wait Time Analytics

## 🔷 Project Title & Headline
Emergency Room Operations Dashboard built using SQL and Excel to analyze patient flow, wait times, service efficiency, and satisfaction metrics for hospital decision-making.

---

## 📝 Short Description
This project is an end-to-end healthcare data analytics dashboard focused on Emergency Room operations. Raw ER data was cleaned using SQL and modeled in Excel to track KPIs like patient volume, wait time, admissions, and satisfaction. The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly detect bottlenecks and improve operational efficiency.

## ✨ Features & Highlights

### 📌 Business Problem
Hospitals often struggle to monitor ER performance in real time. Long wait times, uneven patient flow, and department bottlenecks reduce service quality and patient satisfaction. There is a need for a KPI-driven dashboard to monitor ER efficiency.

---

### 🎯 Dashboard Goal
- Track total ER patient visits  
- Measure average wait time  
- Monitor admission vs non-admission rates  
- Analyze patient demographics  
- Detect peak load days and hours  
- Support staffing and process improvement decisions  

---

### 📈 Key Visuals Used (and Why)

- **KPI Cards** — show total patients, avg wait time, satisfaction score for quick executive overview  
- **Area Charts** — used for daily patient trends to clearly spot peaks and seasonality  
- **Bar Charts** — compare department referrals and admission status  
- **Pie Charts** — show gender and admission distribution simply  
- **Age Group Charts** — visualize demographic spread using 10-year buckets  
- **Slicers (Month / Year / Department)** — enable interactive drill-down analysis  

---

### 📊 Business Impact & Insights

- Identified peak ER load days to support staffing optimization  
- Detected departments causing longer wait times  
- Measured % of patients attended within 30 minutes  
- Highlighted demographic patterns in ER visits  
- Enabled faster operational monitoring using one dashboard  
- Supports data-driven hospital workflow improvement
